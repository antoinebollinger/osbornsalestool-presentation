<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project 👈

### Context

**Field sales team used to work with very "old fashioned tools":**\
❌ No dynamic access to product data: we only had paper or PDF based catalogs\
❌ No dynamic access to customer data and history: sales prices evolution, product consumption, etc.\
❌ Fragmented data and necessisty to prepare everything manualy before visiting thez customer\
❌ Limited flexibility for in-meeting efficiency\
❌ Unexpected opportunities difficult to handler efficienty


**What about SAP?**\
✔️ Powerful but uneasy to handle: not user-friendly\
✔️ Very well made for ERP and financial planning and control\
❌ Fantastic for office based people BUT not for all field sales oriented\
❌ Very expensive licenses: no access to fiel sales guys\
❌ Everything must be prepared by the back-office before and managed with back-office afterwards

**Conclusion**\
👉 **We started to feel the `need for a modern tool to increase field sales efficiency.`**

### Objectives

🚀 **Improve field sales time to market & dynamic efficiency!**

We wanted to have a flexible and user-friendly IT tool providing:
- [ ] A complete catalog with all informations about each product
- [ ] A following-up of customer with sales historical data
- [ ] The creation and management of prices offers diretly at customer's premises
- [ ] The creation of retail store shelves layout with our products and relevant offer
- [ ] Secured, fast and dynamic access everywhere

### Our solution

We started to developp a flexible and user-friendly tool, based on what the people on the field wanted.

**We first developped an EXCEL based solution, but we faced:**\
👎 A lack of flexibility and maintainability 😱\
👎 Difficulties to adapt on differents devices and softwares versions 😬\
👎 Limited to computer (excluding smartphones and tablets 📵)

**Then we moved to a Web app**
- [x] Flexible, easy to maintain and to enhance
- [x] Accessible from every devices: 🖥️💻 computers, 📱 mobile devices
- [x] Access from everywhere with secure authentification
- [x] Dynamic access to data and modern field sales tool

### Build with

- The interface is coded in **HTML** and styled in **CSS**
- Datas are hosted on a **MySQL** database
- **JavaScript** and the **JQuery** library ensure the dynamic interaction
- The whole app is currently localy hosted on Osborn French server
